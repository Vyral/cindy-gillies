*As we head into the holiday season, we wanted to send our thanks to you and give you some fun new ways to get your kids into the holiday spirit.*

We’re in the thick of the holiday season, today I’m joined by three special guests: Tinsel, Snowflake, and Jingle the mischievous reindeer. These are our “elves on the shelves” who are keeping out kids entertained while they wait for Santa on Christmas. This got us thinking back on our year and how you all have played such an important part in making it great. Today we just wanted to let you know that you are always a bright spot in our day and we hope you have a wonderful holiday season and a happy New Year.

Our elves have been busy with our kids this year with everything from Christmas bingo to apparently getting part-time jobs at Chick-Fil-A.

In the interest of giving, if your elf on the shelf has slowed down and you’re not quite sure what you should be doing next, shoot me an email. We have a pretty great list of activities that the elves can do with your children and bring some more of that Christmas joy.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
