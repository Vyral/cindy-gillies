Are you wanting to get involved with our local community and make a difference? **<u><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbbsfred.org/">Big Brothers Big Sisters</a></u>** of Greater Fredericksburg is hosting a great event for people of all ages: Bowl for Kids’ Sake. &nbsp;

**It takes place on March 2 and 3 at the AMF Fredericksburg Bowl, located at 12100 Kilarney Drive.&nbsp;**

**We’ve always been huge supporters of the Big Brothers Big Sisters organization.** It’s a wonderful community program that pairs mentors with kids, providing children with a positive role model and great experiences. Mentors are supported by professional staff who ensure the fit is a good one and that the needs of the child are always met. Many young people have felt the impact made by the program.
