It’s hard to believe that spring is already upon us, but now that it is, it’s time for a market update.

There are currently 592 active listings in our local market with an additional 482 homes currently under contract. **These numbers are fairly standard for what one would expect of this time of year, so this bodes well for the general health of our market.&nbsp;**

Interestingly enough, the number of homes sold this year (753) is nearly identical to the number that sold last year (752).&nbsp;

The average amount of time homes are spending on the market, however, has definitely increased. Between January 1 through the end of April, single-family homes spent an average of 58 days on market in 2018. This year, the average days on market across all properties is 77, while the current average for single-family homes is more than 80 days. This is something we’re definitely proud of.

Detached homes followed a similar trend over the past twelve months, with 591 having sold in 2018 and 593 having sold this year. And, much like single-family homes, the average number of days on market rose for detached properties, as well. The average days on market for detached homes was 63 in 2018 and 84 this year.&nbsp;

Townhomes also followed this pattern. 137 sold in 2018, while 147 sold this year. The average days on market from townhomes also rose. In 2018, the average days on market is 35. This year, the average days on market was 50.

With that said, **the median sales price for townhomes actually shot up significantly, going from $263,000 in 2018 to $360,500 this year.**&nbsp;

When we look at current market conditions overall, it’s clear that although buyer activity has slowed, properties are still definitely selling.&nbsp;
