After all the exhilaration of last year’s roller coaster of a housing market (which was a virtual clone of 2017), we’re looking ahead to a very reliable, strong real estate market in 2019. We ended the year feeling a distinct softening for sellers at around 27% fewer units sold countywide compared to last December (126 vs 176). The median sale price – which is a much more reliable market indicator than average sale price – was up 2% in 2018 year-over-year from $330,000 to $335,000. Days-on-Market in December 2018 (how long it takes a home to enter contract once it’s been listed) averaged 69 days, which was a 5% decrease than the December ’17. That means homes sold slightly faster at the end of 2018 compared to 2017; however, active inventory was almost identical for both periods. We are seeing Stafford numbers come in very similar on most metrics.
