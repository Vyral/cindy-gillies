{% include youtube.html %}We’re in the midst of the busy holiday season so I want to take a quick second to wish all of you a Very Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. So many of the memories we hold dear happen this time of year and many of them happen in the home. &nbsp;Reflecting on the work we do every day, it warms our hearts to know that we had a small part in the making of these cherished memories. We are so thankful for all of you and the trust you place in us. 2019 is going to be an exciting year but don’t forget to take a little time between now and the new year to slow down and enjoy the ride. Merry Christmas & Happy New Year!
