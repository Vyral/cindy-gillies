Are you wanting to get involved with our local community and make a difference? **<u><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbbsfred.org/">Big Brothers Big Sisters</a></u>** of Greater Fredericksburg is hosting a great event for people of all ages: Bowl for Kids’ Sake. &nbsp;

**It takes place on March 2 and 3 at the AMF Fredericksburg Bowl, located at 12100 Kilarney Drive.&nbsp;**

**We’ve always been huge supporters of the Big Brothers Big Sisters organization.** It’s a wonderful community program that pairs mentors with kids, providing children with a positive role model and great experiences. Mentors are supported by professional staff who ensure the fit is a good one and that the needs of the child are always met. We've heard countless stories from past and current Littles telling us just how big of an impact this program has had on their lives.

We’d love for you, your friends, and your family to join us at this upcoming event. If you would like to participate, you can do one of a few things: a) you can bowl and help raise funds (bowlers usually raise about $100/person), b) you can donate through our team to the organization, or c) if you are a small business you can become a sponsor (ground level sponsorship $200). Funds go to raise money for the organization so they can continue their community outreach. If you can’t attend but would still like to donate, **contact us to learn how to contribute.**

We’re looking forward to fun with friends and family while helping a great local organization, and we hope to see you there! Make sure to **<u><a target="_blank" href="https://amplify.netdonor.net/8543/bfks2019">register here</a></u>**. To learn more, watch this video.
