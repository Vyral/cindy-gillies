 Real estate, much like the stock market, can change dramatically within just a few years. Over the last 24 months in Stafford County, we’ve seen huge increases in home values as well as major swings in inventory. This has led many people to wonder if our housing market is shifting. I recently wrote an article that goes into detail about the current market and whether I believe that we’re seeing a shift. To read it in its entirety, follow this <a href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/9c45d21d-bbbf-4239-a53d-cca533bf21c0" target="_blank">link.</a>
