  It doesn’t look like we’ll be having our Fredericksburg Nationals event this
  year, so we’re shifting those funds over to our new initiative GT RUNS. Here’s
  what we hope to accomplish with this program.

Today I’m not here to talk about real estate. I’m here to announce the start of GT RUNS, which stands for Gillies Team Random Urgent Needs Served. With all that’s going on in the world right now, we want to give back to our community. The funds that were planned for our Fredericksburg Nationals event are now being shifted towards GT RUNS. We’re going to use this initiative to identify urgent needs in our community due to the COVID-19 pandemic and help out those in need.&nbsp;
