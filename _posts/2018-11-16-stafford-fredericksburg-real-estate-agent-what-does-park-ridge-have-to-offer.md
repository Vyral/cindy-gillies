Today, there are a couple of messages we’d like to share with you all. First, we want to wish you a happy Thanksgiving.

There’s something about this holiday that gives it a special place in my heart. There’s no better feeling than gathering with loved ones to enjoy great food and great conversation. Thanksgiving is also a great time during which to reflect on the things we’re thankful for. And here at the Gillies Team, we’re thankful for you. We wouldn’t be where we are today without you.

Moving on, we would also like to let you know about the launch of our new neighborhood spotlight series, which we’re kicking off today with a look at Park Ridge. There’s something for everyone in this neighborhood, including townhomes, as well as single-family and multi-family properties.

Located right in the middle of North Stafford, just a few minutes off of I-95, Park Ridge offers convenient proximity to neighboring areas, but also has many amenities and resources of its own.

One of the main reasons Park Ridge is so popular, though, is the fact that there are over 1,200 homes within it. 80 homes have sold in the past 12 months in this neighborhood, which just goes to show how active the market here is.

If you or someone you know is interested in learning more about this neighborhood, please reach out. My team would love to help in any way we can. Speaking of which, if you happen to be without plans on Thanksgiving and are looking for someone to spend it with, there’s always room at my table. I can’t tell you how many years I’ve been blessed to have someone turn up to celebrate with my loved ones and me. We’d be glad to have you.

If you have any other questions or would like more information on what's happening in a different neighborhood, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
