{% include youtube.html %}Halloween is almost here, so today I’m joined by some of the raving Halloween fans right here in our office to share some quick tips to ensure you have a safe, happy Halloween. For example, if you’ll be driving around during the night, make sure you slow down and watch for kids crossing the street. If you’re a parent and you’ll be out trick-or-treating with your kids, don’t forget to bring along flashlights and glowsticks, and check your kids’ candy bags and make sure they only eat commercially wrapped candy.

From all of us at The Gillies Team, we want to wish you a happy Halloween. Remember, if you’re buying or selling a home soon or you have any real estate needs we can take care of, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
