As agents, we tend to be in our car a lot. A question I hear all the time is, “What’s going on with all the road projects in the area?” Today I’m going to take you through a little tour of Stafford near I-95 and talk about some of the current and future projects that are planned and what that might mean for you. **Here’s an outline of the video, with timestamps so that you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you the most.**
