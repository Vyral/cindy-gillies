Do not waste money by throwing away your outdoor furniture and buying brand new pieces. Do this instead.

Today we just wanted to give you a quick outdoor home tip. Instead of replacing your dirty outdoor furniture cushions or trying to wash them in the washing machine, you should consider power washing them instead. Not only will it save you time and money, but it is also pretty fun to do.

The cushions in the video above are a few years old and as you can see, they are pretty gross from wind, rain, pollen, etc. Instead of replacing them, I decided to use a power washer to make them look brand new.

One thing you do not want to do is get too close to the cushion with the sprayer, because the power washer will rip it. If you maintain a little distance, however, you can get into every nook and cranny and your cushions will be looking like new by the end.

Check out how easy this is in the video above. In just 30 seconds, I got the cushions looking brand new.

A few more things you should consider power washing are concrete steps, your front door, and your driveway. Once you are done, make sure you get those cushions out to dry in the sun.

That is just a quick, fun tip for you today. If you have any questions about the real estate market, or specifically about how to prepare your home to sell for top dollar, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
