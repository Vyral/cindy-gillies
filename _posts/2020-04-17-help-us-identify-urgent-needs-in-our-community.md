Today I'm pressing pause on the real estate updates. I'm announcing the start of an exciting new program called GT RUNS. This stands for Gillies Team - Random Urgent Needs Served. There are many very serious and unexpected hardships in our community right now. We have decided that the funds planned for our Fredericksburg Nationals event will be immediately shifted to GT RUNS. We're going to use this initiative to identify urgent needs in our community due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lend a hand to local individuals and families in need.&nbsp;

We need your help to identify these needs\! Please email us at [GTRUNS@gilliesteam.com](mailto:GTRUNS@gilliesteam.com) to let us know if you or someone you know needs assistance during this difficult time. Any requests will be 100% confidential.

Let's band together and show our community that we're better together and that we have their back\!
