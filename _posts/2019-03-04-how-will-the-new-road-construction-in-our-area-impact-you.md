As you know, some considerable highway expansion is about to take place along the Capital Beltway. Today's segment is part 1 of a 2 part series we put together covering the new local addition.

Governor Northam recently announced that **the company Transurban would be building three miles’ worth of HOV road extension along I-495 near the American Legion Memorial Bridge.** This is a heavy-traffic area, and many people in our area use I-495 to commute to work. Additionally, Transurban will be extending the HOV lanes on the center median of I-495 all the way down to the Falmouth interchange.&nbsp;

This is an exciting development, and billions of dollars of investment are being poured into it. A huge portion of that investment is going into the Stafford/Fredericksburg area, and there are two construction projects within this development that you need to be aware of.

The first is the **widening of Courthouse Road and the construction of the new Courthouse Interchange in north Stafford.** This is a high-growth area of Stafford, so this project is long overdue. Construction has been underway since 2018, and some areas of the road have already been completed. There’s still a lot of work to do, but the completion date is set for July 2020. This should change the landscape of this area and generate quite a bit of new commercial development.&nbsp;

For the second project, **Courthouse Road will be moved south to connect with Hospital Center Boulevard.** This should take some of the traffic flow away from the intersection next to the Stafford County courthouse. For anyone who travels this area regularly, this development is a welcome sight. There’s no timeline yet, but construction is set to begin sometime in 2020.&nbsp;

In the meantime, I’ll keep an eye on these projects and continue to provide updates as they come. If you have any questions about this topic or anything real estate-related, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you<br>&nbsp;
