It is Mid-July now, which means two things. First, I missed my chance to send you all a greeting for the Fourth, which I hope you enjoyed. Second, it’s hot out here and I am excited to highlight an awesome Stafford community today: Augustine North.&nbsp;

**Augustine is a unique community in our area.** It’s one of &nbsp;few communities that center around a gorgeous golf course and the amenities that go along with it. When you look at Augustine, the golf course is usually the first thing that comes to mind, but it’s not the only thing that should.

**In addition to the great course, homes in Augustine are unique in their lot size.** They range anywhere from a quarter acre to an acre and a half or more. Most lots are somewhere between a third and a half an acre. It’s a nice middle ground where the lots aren’t small, but they don’t have to be huge either.

There are just over 400 homes here in Augustine. In the last 12 months, 20 of them have sold, making the turnover rate around 5%. This low rate tells us that a lot of people who buy here tend to stay here. We love working in this neighborhood and even have some family that lives here too. Right now, three are four homes on the market, four under contract, and six that sold in June. **Half of this year’s 12 sales in Augustine happened in June\!**

As far as price ranges are concerned, they typically go from about $470,000 on the low end up to around $625,000 and above. It all depends on the home, the age, its upgrades, and more.

**Some of the outstanding amenities I mentioned earlier can be found at the community center.** They include a great pool, tennis courts, and a gorgeous clubhouse complete with a restaurant inside.

To get a firsthand look of all the fantastic views, amenities, and homes that I’ve mentioned, watch the full video above.

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you.
