I shot this video in mid-July and I'm so sorry I'm just now bringing it to you\! It's the middle of summer which means two things. First, I missed my chance to send you all a greeting for the Fourth of July, which I hope you enjoyed. Second, it's hot out here and a perfect time to highlight an amazing Stafford community today: Augustine North.

**Augustine is a unique community in our area.** It's one of few communities that center around a gorgeous golf course and the amenities that go along with it. When people think about Augustine, the golf course is usually the first thing that comes to mind, but it's not the only thing that should.

**In addition to the great course, homes in Augustine are unique in their lot size.** They range anywhere from a quarter acre to an acre and a half or more. Most lots are somewhere between a third and a half an acre. It's a nice middle ground where the lots aren't small, but they aren't overwhelming to take care of.

There are just over 400 homes in Augustine. In the last 12 months, 20 of them have sold, making the turnover rate around 5%. This low rate tells us that a lot of people who buy here tend to stay here. We love working in this neighborhood and have family that lives in the community. As of this video shoot, there are four homes on the market, four under contract, and six that sold in June. **Half of this year’s 12 sales in Augustine happened in June\!**

When it comes to pricing, homes typically sell from about $470,000 on the lower end up to $625,000 and above. It all depends on the individual home, the age, its upgrades, and more.

**Some of the outstanding amenities I mentioned earlier can be found at the community center.** They include an outstanding, private pool, tennis courts, and miles of walking trails. The gorgeous clubhouse houses the pro shop, locker rooms and a full-service restaurant and bar. Enjoy a round of golf or a meal on the beautiful patio overlooking the 18th green.

To get a firsthand look of all the fantastic views, amenities, and homes that I’ve mentioned, watch the full video above.

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. No one sells Augustine like The Gillies Team. If you're looking at buying or selling in the community give us a call\! I look forward to hearing from you.
