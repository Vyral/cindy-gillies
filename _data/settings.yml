    <strong>REAL ESTATE DONE DIFFERENTLY</strong><br>
    Ranked as the top real estate team in the Stafford/Fredericksburg area, Michael and his team of real estate advisers have sold over $400 million dollars in real estate. We know the real estate experience can be daunting which is why we have developed a proven process creating a simpler, hassle-free experience with open lines of communication.

    At the Gillies Team, our #1 priority is to provide a convenient, consistent world class experience 100% of the time.

    Too many people come to us after becoming frustrated, feeling like they are going at it alone with no idea what was coming around the next bend. We believe you should be feeling confident and informed every step of the way. You should know what to expect and get what's expected. For this reason we have chosen to do real estate differently.

    <strong>What makes us different?</strong>

    <strong>GUARANTEE PROGRAMS</strong><br>
    We want you to feel secure so we eliminate the risk.

    <strong>INDIVIDUAL STRATEGY PLANS</strong><br>
    We listen to each individual need and make recommendations based on what's best for our client. We base every decision on what's best for our client.

    <strong>SUPPORT & COMMUNICATION PLAN</strong><br>
    Our team of specialists provide minute to minute support and communication. From our buyer and listing specialist teams to our in-office marketing, contract processing, client care, sales manager and finance members, we ensure all I's are dotted and T's are crossed. We cater to needs you didn't even know you had.

    <strong>HASSLE FREE</strong><br>
    Your time is valuable. You should not be the one doing the job of a real estate agent. Our proactive approach predicts, avoids and absorbs bumps in the road so you can focus on the most important things in your life.

    <strong>So, let us take the weight off your shoulders. That's what we do best.</strong>
